/*!
This crate provides an implementation of the
[Snappy compression format](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/format_description.txt),
as well as the
[framing format](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/framing_format.txt).
The goal of Snappy is to provide reasonable compression at high speed. On a
modern CPU, Snappy can compress data at about 300 MB/sec or more and can
decompress data at about 800 MB/sec or more.

# Install

To use this crate with
[Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/index.html),
simply add it as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```ignore
[dependencies]
snap = "0.2"
```

and add `extern crate snap;` to your crate root.

# Overview

This crate provides two ways to use Snappy. The first way is through the
`Reader` and `Writer` types, which implement the `std::io::Read` and
`std::io::Write` traits with the Snappy frame format. Unless you have a
specific reason to the contrary, you should only need to use these types.
Specifically, the Snappy frame format permits streaming compression or
decompression.

The second way is through the `Decoder` and `Encoder` types. These types
provide lower level control to the raw Snappy format, and don't support a
streaming interface directly. You should only use these types if you know you
specifically need the Snappy raw format.

Finally, the `Error` type in this crate provides an exhaustive list of error
conditions that are probably useless in most circumstances. Therefore,
`From<snap::Error> for io::Error` is implemented in this crate, which will let
you automatically convert a Snappy error to an `std::io::Error` (when using
`try!`) with an appropriate error message to display to an end user.

# Example: compress data on `stdin`

This program reads data from `stdin`, compresses it and emits it to `stdout`.
This example can be found in `examples/compress.rs`:

```rust,ignore
extern crate snap;

use std::io;

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = io::stdout();

    let mut rdr = stdin.lock();
    // Wrap the stdout writer in a Snappy writer.
    let mut wtr = snap::Writer::new(stdout.lock());
    io::copy(&mut rdr, &mut wtr).expect("I/O operation failed");
}
```

# Example: decompress data on `stdin`

This program reads data from `stdin`, decompresses it and emits it to `stdout`.
This example can be found in `examples/decompress.rs`:

```rust,ignore
extern crate snap;

use std::io;

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = io::stdout();

    // Wrap the stdin reader in a Snappy reader.
    let mut rdr = snap::Reader::new(stdin.lock());
    let mut wtr = stdout.lock();
    io::copy(&mut rdr, &mut wtr).expect("I/O operation failed");
}
```
