// Sadly, all of the crc crates in Rust appear to be insufficient for high
// performance algorithms. In fact, the implementation here is insufficient!
// The best implementation uses the CRC32 instruction from SSE 4.2, but using
// specialty instructions on stable Rust is an absolute nightmare at the
// moment. The only way I can think to do it is to write some Assembly in a
// separate source file and run an Assembler from build.rs. But we'd need to be
// careful to only do this on platforms that support the CRC32 instruction,
// which means we'd need to query CPUID. There are a couple Rust crates for
// that, but of course, they only work on unstable Rust so we'd need to hand
// roll that too.
//
// As a stopgap, we implement the fastest (slicing-by-16) algorithm described
// here: http://create.stephan-brumme.com/crc32/
// (Actually, slicing-by-16 doesn't seem to be measurably faster than
// slicing-by-8 on my i7-6900K, so use slicing-by-8.)
//
// For Snappy, we only care about CRC32C (32 bit, Castagnoli).
//
// ---AG

// We have a bunch of different implementations of crc32 below that seem
// somewhat useful to leave around for easy benchmarking.
