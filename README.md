snap
====
A pure Rust implementation of the
[Snappy compression algorithm](http://google.github.io/snappy/).
Includes streaming compression and decompression using the Snappy frame format.
This implementation is ported from both the
[reference C++ implementation](https://github.com/google/snappy)
and the
[Go implementation](https://github.com/golang/snappy).

### Documentation

https://docs.rs/snap

### Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
snap = "0.2"
```

### Example: compress data on `stdin`

This program reads data from `stdin`, compresses it and emits it to `stdout`.
This example can be found in `examples/compress.rs`:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = io::stdout();

    let mut rdr = stdin.lock();
    // Wrap the stdout writer in a Snappy writer.
    let mut wtr = snap::Writer::new(stdout.lock());
    io::copy(&mut rdr, &mut wtr).expect("I/O operation failed");
}
```

### Example: decompress data on `stdin`

This program reads data from `stdin`, decompresses it and emits it to `stdout`.
This example can be found in `examples/decompress.rs`:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = io::stdout();

    // Wrap the stdin reader in a Snappy reader.
    let mut rdr = snap::read::FrameDecoder::new(stdin.lock());
    let mut wtr = stdout.lock();
    io::copy(&mut rdr, &mut wtr).expect("I/O operation failed");
}
```

### Example: the szip tool

`szip` is a tool with similar behavior as `gzip`, except it uses Snappy
compression. It can be installed with Cargo:

```
$ cargo install szip
```

To compress a file, run `szip file`. To decompress a file, run
`szip -d file.sz`. See `szip --help` for more details.

### Testing

This crate is tested against the reference C++ implementation of Snappy.
Currently, compression is byte-for-byte equivalent with the C++ implementation.
This seems like a reasonable starting point, although it is not necessarily
a goal to always maintain byte-for-byte equivalence.

Tests against the reference C++ implementation can be run with
`cargo test --features cpp`. Note that you will need to have the C++ Snappy
library in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or equivalent).

To run tests, you'll need to explicitly run the `test` crate:

```
$ cargo test --manifest-path test/Cargo.toml
```

To test that this library matches the output of the reference C++ library, use:

```
$ cargo test --manifest-path test/Cargo.toml --features cpp
```

Tests are in a separate crate because of the dependency on the C++ reference
library. Namely, Cargo does not yet permit optional dev dependencies.

### Performance

The performance of this implementation should roughly match the performance of
the C++ implementation on x86_64. Below are the results of the microbenchmarks
(as defined in the C++ library):

Notes: These benchmarks were run with Snappy/C++ on commit `32d6d7` with debug
assertions disabled. Both the C++ and Rust benchmarks were run with the same
benchmark harness. Benchmarks were run on an Intel i7-6900K.

For reference, here are the benchmarks run on the same machine from the Go
implementation of Snappy (which has a hand rolled implementation in Assembly).
Note that these were run using Go's microbenchmark tool.

### Comparison with other Snappy crates

* `snappy` - These are bindings to the C++ library. No support for the Snappy
  frame format.
* `snappy_framed` - Implements the Snappy frame format on top of the `snappy`
  crate.
* `rsnappy` - Written in pure Rust, but lacks documentation and the Snappy
  frame format. Performance is unclear and tests appear incomplete.
* `snzip` - Was created and immediately yanked from crates.io.
